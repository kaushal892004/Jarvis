# 🤖 Jarvis: Your Personal AI Assistant 🚀

Jarvis is a smart, voice-activated personal assistant designed to perform a variety of tasks, including speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and executing commands like opening applications, providing information, and more. Built with Python, it leverages libraries like `pyttsx3`, `speech_recognition`, and `PyAudio` to deliver an interactive user experience.

---

## Features 🌟

- **Voice Recognition**: Understands and processes spoken commands using `speech_recognition`.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts text into natural-sounding speech using `pyttsx3`.
- **Task Automation**: Executes system-level commands (e.g., opening applications, searching the web).
- **Extensible Design**: Easily add new commands and functionalities.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation 📦

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
2. Virtual environment (optional but recommended).

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaushal892004/Jarvis.git
   cd jarvis
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Ensure that `PyAudio` is correctly installed. If there are installation issues, you can use the following commands:
   - On **Linux**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
     pip install pyaudio
     ```
   - On **macOS**:
     ```bash
     brew install portaudio
     pip install pyaudio
     ```
   - On **Windows**:
     Download a compatible `PyAudio` `.whl` file from [PyAudio Downloads](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio) and install:
     ```bash
     pip install path_to_downloaded_file.whl
     ```

## Usage 🚀

1. Run the Jarvis script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Speak your commands after the assistant starts listening. Example commands:
   - "Open Google"
   - "What is the time?"
   - "Search for Python tutorials"
